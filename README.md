## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes **GST (Goods and Services Tax) collection data** across Indian states using Google Looker Studio.

The objective was to transform raw tax data into an **interactive and decision-driven Business Intelligence dashboard** that helps identify:

- Revenue trends
- High and low performing states
- Geographic revenue distribution
- Monthly growth patterns
- Policy-level improvement opportunities

This dashboard demonstrates how financial data can be converted into actionable national-level insights.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

GST is one of India's primary revenue sources. However, raw spreadsheet data does not provide:

- Clear state-wise performance comparison  
- Identification of revenue gaps  
- Visibility into regional imbalance

To address this challenge, an interactive and structured BI dashboard was developed.
